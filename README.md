# D3

Repository for starting with d3.js library (https://d3js.org).

**What is d3.js?** It is javascript module allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. D3â€™s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of official and community-developed modules.

**How does d3 get DOM elements?** You can get DOM elements by ```d3.select([selector])```.
